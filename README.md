# C-Programming-Dynamic-Programming
This program calculates the nth Fibonacci number using Dynamic Programming in C.   It applies a bottom-up approach by storing results in an array to avoid recomputation.   Base cases are initialized as F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.   The time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(n).   This approach is more efficient than simple recursion.
